                        My name is Bradley May and yep you figured it out! Jessica is my wife.<br>
                        We met online on Match.com in December of 2016. On January 22, 2017 I asked her out.<br>
                        By July of that year we packed up everything we owned and moved 2000 miles away from everything and everyone we knew.<br>
                        But enough about us this page is about her.

                        Jessica entered this world bright eyed and bushy tailed. Her mother Jocelyne Montas imagrated from Hait,<br>
                        and raised 5 great kids. Jessica was her 4th child. Jessica also had dreams of working in the medical field, like her mom.<br>
                        Jessica attened SouthTech Academy, there she took classes for the medical science graduated with Personal Care Assistants (PCA),<br>
                        Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), and Home Health Aid certificates in 2009.

                        After high school Jessica worked as a Home Health Aid and CNA for multiple companies.<br>
                        Still Jessica knew this was not the path she wanted to stay in for a career. In 2012 Jessica started looking at other options<br>
                        in the healthcare world. She came across Registered Nurse (RN) and started looking and applying for schools in the area.<br>
                        In 2013 Jessica got accepted into Dade Medical College. There she took all the coruses needed to get her Associate's degree in Nursing.<br>
                        In October 2014 Jessica found out that she was pregnate with her first child. Still that did not stop Jessica she contuined the coruse<br>
                        and graduated in Novomber 2015. In January 2016 Jessica when to take her NCLEX-RN exam. She still tells me to this day how<br>
                        nervous she was and even though she was the last examinee in the room she still pressed hard and PASSED the NCLEX-RN to officaling be come an RN.

                        Once I met Jessica in 2016 I knew that we had the same goal and ambisitions in life.<br>
                        At the time we had both spent our lives in South Florida.<br>
                        On our first date we talked about how we didn't want to live in Florida the rest of our lives.<br>
                        As time went on we contunied to speak and speak more about moving.<br>
                        On July 1st, 2017 just 7 short months after meeting we had everything packed and moved 2000 miles away.<br>
                        Both excited to start a new advanture in life. We arrived in Colorado Springs on July 3rd, 2017<br>
                        Jessica had already had 2 jobs as an RN and started them on July 10th. Jessica worked one full-time job and a PRN.<br>
                        She started with days but quickly learned that did not mesh well with Ezra's scheuld,<br>
                        and swiched to nights. Jessica would work 8 hour shifts and then pick up 2 days a week at her PRN job for 12 hour shifts.<br>
                        Contuining to work hard Jessica kept looking for something different.<br>
                        While she loved being a RN and helping people and setting the high for all the other nurses around her.<br>
                        Working in all parts of the nursing indstury from Home Health, Long-Term, Acute, Case Managment, and Hospital.<br>
                        Jessica contunited to tell me day in and day out how she was not done and wanted to more out of nursing.<br>
                        In March 2019 Jessica jumped up out of bed in the moring and <br>
                        "I'm doing it I'm going back to school to get my Master's in nursing and becoming an FNP" (Family Nurse Pratnatier)<br>
